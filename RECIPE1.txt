== Introduction ==

Data Twist is an experimental script family to twist Open Data into new shapes.

These scripts are designed to take OpenStreetMap XML data and import it into a
geo-aware version of Wordpress. This allows information like shops and tourist
locations to quickly populate directories, at least in theory.

The initial focus is on allowing OSM website XML downloads, XAPI pulls and
Osmosis node filters from a database to be converted into SQL files that we can
quickly load into a Wordpress install. There are some dependencies at the
moment, with the key item being the Geo Mashup plug-in for Wordpress to allow
us to store geo-references with each post.

Data Twist is not a solution for making local directories by itself. It is the
foundation for doing so via Open Data in the form of a OpenStreetMap's
database.

Data Twist is a Ruby application. It was originally coded in Spring 2013 by
Kana Fukuma and Shane Coughlan over a four day (24 hour) hack session. Our
goal was to provide proof-of-concept regarding the "twisting" of Open Data
into new use cases. The idea is that this can help more people do more cool
things.

== Usage ==

To use the current root solution as of 19th February 2013, execute a command
with "ruby output_sql3.rb"

This will read "osm-website-central-matsue-min.osm.xml" and use "sql_format.sql"
as a templete to write the output file. At the moment that is called
"o_sql07.sql"

There are those who say we don't think up sexy names for our files. They are
wrong.

Anyway, load "o_sql07.sql" into your Wordpress MySQL database. Don't
forget to install Wordpress and the Geo Mashup plug-in first.

== Recipe 1 ==

The first recipe is to filter data from OpenStreetMap that was obtained with
the website XML download. We then load that data into a vanilla
