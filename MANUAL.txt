== Introduction ==

Data Twist is an experimental script family to twist Open Data into new shapes.

These scripts are designed to take OpenStreetMap XML data and import it into a
geo-aware version of Wordpress. This allows information like shops and tourist
locations to quickly populate directories, at least in theory.

The initial focus is on allowing OSM website XML downloads, XAPI pulls and
Osmosis node filters from a database to be converted into SQL files that we can
quickly load into a Wordpress install. There are some dependencies at the
moment, with the key item being the Geo Mashup plug-in for Wordpress to allow
us to store geo-references with each post.

Data Twist is not a solution for making local directories by itself. It is the
foundation for doing so via Open Data in the form of a OpenStreetMap's
database.

Data Twist is a Ruby application. It was originally coded in Spring 2013 by
Kana Fukuma and Shane Coughlan over a four day (24 hour) hack session. Our
goal was to provide proof-of-concept regarding the "twisting" of Open Data
into new use cases. The idea is that this can help more people do more cool
things.

== Dependancies ==

Data Twist has some dependancies.

(1) A working Ruby installation. We used version 1.9.2p290.
(2) An XML version of the OpenStreetMap data. The ".osm" files will work.
(3) A vanilla Wordpress installation. We used version 3.5.1.
(4) The Geo Mashup plug-in for Wordpress installed. We used version 1.5.2.

To protect your sanity while playing with massive amounts of data from
OpenStreetMap you will probably also find Osmosis and OSMembrane useful.

Osmosis is the Java-based command line tool for manipulating OpenStreetMap
data. It works very well on its own. We used version 0.41:
http://bretth.dev.openstreetmap.org/osmosis-build/osmosis-0.41.tgz
http://bretth.dev.openstreetmap.org/osmosis-build/osmosis-0.41.zip
http://dev.openstreetmap.de:23457/hudson/job/osmosis-release/6/

When dealing with large data-sets you might need various command-line options
to ensure the process completes. It's a lot easier to hand over this job to
someone else, and that's where OSMembrane comes it. It calls Osmosis in a
smart and easy way. We used OSMembrane Build 845:
http://code.google.com/p/osmembrane-gui/

== Known Issues ==

Data Twist has several known issues.
(1) It will probably only work on a vanilla Wordpress installation. This is
due to the way that we write directly to the Wordpress database both for
creating new posts and for adding geo-data to Geo Mashup tables. This places
some limitations on how you can use it.
(2) It will probably only work on single site installations of Wordpress for
much the same reasons as point (1). This issue, as with point (1), can be
overcome with testing. It's a code maturity issue.
(3) Data Twist can conflict with Wordpress plug-ins that want to oversee
posts. For example, we encountered errors with getting it to work on a
Wordpress installation with WPML. This is a high-priority bug and will be
address in the next development phase.
(4) Data Twist currently fails when trying to import duplicate OpenStreetMap
data. For example, if the data has the same ID, it fails.

== Extracting Big Data ==

There are different types of OpenStreetMap data that you can download and use
as the basis of local maps or directories.

If you want to download the whole world, you can obtain "the planet" from the
OpenStreetMap project website at this URL:
http://planet.openstreetmap.org/planet/
(you want to download planet-latest.osm.bz2)

You can also download extracts by continent or country at this URL:
http://download.geofabrik.de/openstreetmap/

We downloaded some test data for Tokyo city at this URL:
http://metro.teczno.com

However, this resource looks even more promising for quick tests:
http://download.bbbike.org/osm/

We started our testing on simple (and outdate) XML data from Cloudmade:
http://downloads.cloudmade.com
This data is from the OpenStreetMap database, but be aware that supporting its
structure will not mean you can support imports from most OpenStreetMap
resources. To do that please look at the links above.

Our second test data-sets were obtained via the OpenStreetMap XAPI. Here is an
example dataset of 223 public libraries in London, UK that we used:
wget --timeout=0  http://open.mapquestapi.com/xapi/api/0.6/node[amenity=library][bbox=-0.57,51.24,0.31,51.75] -O data.osm

This data was useful to help us do basic imports, though when we tried to
scale up to larger datasets using a similar command we ran into database
duplication errors around the entries. This issue is worth expanding on, as
it is something you are likely to find when experimenting too. Learn more here:
https://github.com/shanecoughlan/data-twist/issues/5

As we proceeded from simple OpenStreetMap XML to more complex sets we decided
to focus on the website export from OpenStreetMap for our test-case setup, and
loaded data from Matsue city, Shimane Prefecture, Japan. This data is lined
up to be our first "demo recipe", and will be complemented by a second
"demo recipe" using Osmosis data in time.

Essentially the import process filters <nodes> by searching for <tag> with
" k="amenity" v="type" " data inside. We use the "amenity" as a positive hit
and the "type" as an information type listed in the resulting Wordpress post.
We read the <tag> that contains the name and use this as the title. We also
read the node timestamp and use this both to record a data for the information
and to show a "last updated" note in the relevant post.

== Usage ==

You will notice several different files and directories in our GitHub
repository. Essentially we are included the proof-of-concept steps that lead
us to the currently-used solution, which will always be located in the root.

To use the current root solution as of 19th February 2013, execute a command
with "ruby output_sql3.rb"

This will read "osm-website-central-matsue-min.osm.xml" and use "sql_format.sql"
as a templete to write the output file. At the moment that is called
"o_sql07.sql"

There are those who say we don't think up sexy names for our files. They are
wrong.

Anyway, load "o_sql07.sql" into your Wordpress MySQL database. Don't
forget to install Wordpress and the Geo Mashup plug-in first.


There are three iterations of our experiments in the current repo.

The first is simpleXML2XML, where a Ruby script takes simple POI from a
Cloudmade download to transform the data into a format that allows import
through the Wordpress RSS import feature. This allowed import of items
that did not have duplicate titles, but ran into issue with the automatic
duplication filter used by Wordpress for RSS import.

The second is simpleXML2dbXML, an experiment to push the data directly into
a Wordpress MySQL database and avoid any duplication filters. This had
import errors with phpMyAdmin. Then we found that an export from the same
application failed to import too, so we decided it's probably better to
look for a more flexbile solution.

The third iteration is simpleXML2SQL, which allows us to convert the data
from OpenStreetMap into a format that can be imported into a Wordpress
database in several ways. It looks like a winner, and Kana included geo
awareness for the Geo Mashup plug-in.

The basic usage instructions for the earlier proof-of-concept code is the
same, but please restrict usage to the test data included in each folder. It's
unlikely to work elsewhere.

== Notes ==

This project provides a proof-of-concept for twisting OpenStreetMap data
into new shapes. In our case we are helping people build Open Source
geo-directories using Open Data (OpenStreetMap) and Open Source (Wordpress) as
a foundation.
