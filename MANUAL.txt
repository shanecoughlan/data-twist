== Introduction ==

Data Twist is an experimental script family to twist Open Data into new shapes.

These scripts are designed to take OpenStreetMap XML data and import it into a
geo-aware version of Wordpress. This allows information like shops and tourist
locations to quickly populate directories, at least in theory.

The initial focus is on allowing XAPI, OSM website XML downloads and Osmosis
node filters from a database to be converted into SQL files that we can quickly
load into a Wordpress install. There are some dependencies at the moment, with
the key item being the Geo Mashup plug-in for Wordpress to allow us to store
geo-references with each post.

Data Twist is not a solution for making local directories by itself. It is the
foundation for doing so via Open Data in the form of a OpenStreetMap's
database.

Data Twist is a Ruby application. It was originally coded in Spring 2013 by
Kana Fukuma and Shane Coughlan over a four day (24 hour) hack session. Our
goal was to provide proof-of-concept regarding the "twisting" of Open Data
into new use cases. The idea is that this can help more people do more cool
things.

== Dependancies ==

Data Twist has some dependancies.

(1) A working Ruby installation. We used version
(2) An XML version of the OpenStreetMap data. The ".osm" files will work.
(3) A vanilla Wordpress installation. We used version 3.5.1.
(4) The Geo Mashup plug-in for Wordpress installed. We used version 1.5.2.

To protect your sanity while playing with massive amounts of data from
OpenStreetMap you will probably also find Osmosis and OSMembrane useful.

Osmosis is the Java-based command line tool for manipulating OpenStreetMap
data. It works very well on its own. We used version 0.41:
http://bretth.dev.openstreetmap.org/osmosis-build/osmosis-0.41.tgz
http://bretth.dev.openstreetmap.org/osmosis-build/osmosis-0.41.zip
http://dev.openstreetmap.de:23457/hudson/job/osmosis-release/6/

When dealing with large data-sets you might need various command-line options
to ensure the process completes. It's a lot easier to hand over this job to
someone else, and that's where OSMembrane comes it. It calls Osmosis in a
smart and easy way. We used OSMembrane Build 845:

== Known Issues ==

Data Twist has several known issues.
(1) It will probably only work on a vanilla Wordpress installation. This is
due to the way that we write directly to the Wordpress database both for
creating new posts and for adding geo-data to Geo Mashup tables. This places
some limitations on how you can use it.
(2) It will probably only work on single site installations of Wordpress for
much the same reasons as point (1). This issue, as with point (1), can be
overcome with testing. It's a code maturity issue.
(3) Data Twist can conflict with Wordpress plug-ins that want to oversee
posts. For example, we encountered errors with getting it to work on a
Wordpress installation with WPML. This is a high-priority bug and will be
address in the next development phase.
(4) Data Twist currently fails when trying to import duplicate OpenStreetMap
data. For example, if the data has the same ID, it fails.

== Extracting Big Data ==

There are different types of OpenStreetMap data that you can download and use
as the basis of local maps or directories.

If you want to download the whole world, you can obtain "the planet" from the
OpenStreetMap project website at this URL:
http://planet.openstreetmap.org/planet/
(you want to download planet-latest.osm.bz2)

You can also download extracts by continent or country at this URL:
http://download.geofabrik.de/openstreetmap/

We downloaded some test data for Tokyo city at this URL:
http://metro.teczno.com

However, this resource looks even more promising for quick tests:
http://download.bbbike.org/osm/

We started our testing on simple (and outdate) XML data from Cloudmade:
http://downloads.cloudmade.com
This data is from the OpenStreetMap database, but be aware that supporting its
structure will not mean you can support imports from most OpenStreetMap
resources. To do that please look at the links above.
