## Release 0.10

Sat Feb 24 12:30:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* In the 'output' area, at "array.each { |a|",
	  item 12 and 19, I substituted "#{a[6]}-#{a[3]}"
	  (the title+ID combination) with "#{a[3]}" (title)
	  to squash a bug with broken URLs and blank posts
	  in Wordpress. Looks good.

## Release 0.6

Wed Feb 20 13:00:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Added OSM "type" to Wordpress "category" support
	  by automatically searching for and extracting
	  "amenity" and "shop" nodes, and associating them
	  with Wordpress categories of the same name.
	  The priority is on "shop" if we find both tags in
	  one entry.
	* Added duplication detection to get around import
	  errors
	* Please note that both features are quite rough at
	  the moment, and will need to (a) have the import
	  parameters expanded and (b) refine their searching
	  and priorities to ensure depth as well as breadth
	  of data.

## Release 0.5

Tue Feb 19 17:00:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Fixed bug with SQL format description that prevented
	  import. It was related to the table field sizes and 
	  types.
	* More specifically:
	  In table `wp_geo_mashup_locations` changed
	  `id` mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `lat` float(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `lng` float(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `saved_name` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
 	  to:
	  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `lat` double(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `lng` double(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `saved_name` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,
	  In table `wp_geo_mashup_locations` changed

	  to: 
	  `location_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
	* Updated documentation
