## Release 0.14

Tue Feb 26 18:30:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Consolidated all the SQL setup stuff into 
	  "sql_format.sql." This means we got rid of 
	  "prepare_term_taxonomy.sql" and "setup_pages.sql",
	  resulting in minus two files (145 lines), with 
	  "sql_format.sql" getting 40 lines fatter.
	* This means today's productivity was -105!

## Release 0.13

Mon Feb 25 12:30:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Added progress feedback while reading the input file

## Release 0.12

Sun Feb 24 23:50:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Added sanity checks for missing input and output files
	* Added variables for program name, version, copyright
	* Updated documentation to reflect new usage

## Release 0.11

Sun Feb 24 13:15:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* There appeared to be a bug with the way that the 
	  sub-categories "shop" and "amenity" were displaying 
	  (see https://github.com/shanecoughlan/data-twist/issues/10)
	  Fixed and tested, so looking good now, though we 
	  might want to dig into this further in the future.

## Release 0.10

Sun Feb 24 12:30:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* In the 'output' area, at "array.each { |a|",
	  item 12 and 19, I substituted "#{a[6]}-#{a[3]}"
	  (the title+ID combination) with "#{a[3]}" (title)
	  to squash a bug with broken URLs and blank posts
	  in Wordpress. Looks good.

	* Cleaned up English language feedback to users
	* Removed the loop when an input filename is not found

	* Removed the loop when an input filename is not found

## Release 0.6

Wed Feb 20 13:00:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Added OSM "type" to Wordpress "category" support
	  by automatically searching for and extracting
	  "amenity" and "shop" nodes, and associating them
	  with Wordpress categories of the same name.
	  The priority is on "shop" if we find both tags in
	  one entry.
	* Added duplication detection to get around import
	  errors
	* Please note that both features are quite rough at
	  the moment, and will need to (a) have the import
	  parameters expanded and (b) refine their searching
	  and priorities to ensure depth as well as breadth
	  of data.

## Release 0.5

Tue Feb 19 17:00:00 2013  Shane Coughlan  <shane@opendawn.com>

	* Fixed bug with SQL format description that prevented
	  import. It was related to the table field sizes and 
	  types.
	* More specifically:
	  In table `wp_geo_mashup_locations` changed
	  `id` mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `lat` float(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `lng` float(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `saved_name` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
 	  to:
	  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `lat` double(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `lng` double(11,7) NOT NULL,
	  `saved_name` varchar(200) DEFAULT NULL,
	  In table `wp_geo_mashup_locations` changed

	  `location_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
	* Updated documentation

	* Test of formatting Cloudmade's basic OSM XML into
