However, with the current version and the sample data there are two annoying glitches that currently requires some manual tweaks. If you are too lazy to do this, just use the pre-build "output.sql" file.

== Bug 1 ==

The first needs a small edit in the output.sql file. We are working on it, and do not regard it as a show-stopper, but rather an irritation.

In the output file you will discover two entries. Their IDs are:
2164634232
2164655980

These entries are causing blank post listings in Wordpress. Deleting them from the SQL tables (search for their unique IDs, you will find them in three places, and just delete those lines) gets rid of the blank entries. The precise reason for this bug is currently unknown.

== Bug 2 ==

Entries that include brackets "( )" in the `post_name` don't display properly via Wordpress. You get a missing page error. This can be an issue with some OpenStreetMap data. It sometimes has a title like "松江 (Matsue)" and that appears as "%E6%9D%BE%E6%B1%9F-(matsue)-265970626"

The solution is to edit such entries to read "%E6%9D%BE%E6%B1%9F-265970626" or similar. In other words, delete "-(ANYTHINGHERE)"

You can do this in the SQL file. We also did it through phpMyAdmin. The solution is probably to change how to show post names, and just use the post ID number to ensure various different languages and strange titles don't break URL formatting.
